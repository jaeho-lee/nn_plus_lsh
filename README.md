# Aww... some papers using LSH on neural nets

This page is to keep myself a reading list of ML algorithm/system/theory papers that combine locality sensitive hashing and deep learning.

Categorization is yet to come.

- Chen et al., [SLIDE : In Defense of Smart Algorithms over Hardware Acceleration for Large-Scale Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03129), MLSys 2020.
- Chen et al., [MONGOOSE: A Learnable LSH Framework for Efficient Neural Network Training](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wWK7yXkULyh), ICLR 2021.
- Kitaev et al., [Reformer: The Efficient Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), ICLR 2020.
- Dikkala et al., [For Manifold Learning, Deep Neural Networks can be Locality Sensitive Hash Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06875), arXiv 2021.
